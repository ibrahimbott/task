Building the **Physical AI Textbook** was not just about writing comparisons of algorithms; it was about designing a learning experience. We wanted to create a resource that felt as high-tech as the subject matter itself.

## The 4 Pillars

We structured the book around the anatomy of a robot, breaking it down into four key pillars:

1.  **The Nervous System**: Covered in [Module 1](/docs/module-1-ros2-nervous-system/index), this explores ROS 2 as the distributed data bus.
2.  **The Body**: In [Module 4](/docs/hardware-basics/module-3-hardware) and [Module 7](/docs/humanoid-design/module-6-humanoid-design), we dive into the nuts and bolts—literally.
3.  **The Twin**: [Module 2](/docs/module-2-digital-twin-simulation/index) and [Module 3](/docs/simulation/module-2-simulation) emphasize that simulation is key to safety.
4.  **The Brain**: Finally, [Module 5](/docs/vla-systems/module-4-vla-foundations) and [Module 6](/docs/advanced-ai-control/module-5-advanced-ai) bring it all to life with VLA and RL.

## Visual Learning

In Physical AI, a picture is worth a thousand lines of code. That's why we invested heavily in creating custom diagrams for every single module.

From the **Zero Moment Point** diagrams to **Lidar Point Clouds**, every image is designed to clarify complex concepts instantly.

We hope this textbook serves as a solid foundation for your own innovations.

Happy Building,
